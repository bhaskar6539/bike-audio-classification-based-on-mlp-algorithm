# bike-audio-classification-based-on-mlp-algorithm
this project is to classify audios of bike in 6 trained classes
it can classify both by real time recording and selected saved file from system
 -required libraries must be installed to run it
the code consist of the gui based run program and without gui 
in  proven chj ver3.py       audios are passed to get it trained and saved the trained model
then in  short program ver3.py       we are just loading saved features and saved model to minimizing the runtime
and traing of model again.
 
 
dataset for this project is according to csv file (bike sp hj.csv)
